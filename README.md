## Build
P6 is written in JAI, a programming language made for games and high performance computing, by 
Jonathan Blow. It uses Raylib as a framework for rendering, sounds and content management.

This program has been compiled with JAI `Version: beta 0.1.092, built on 4 August 2024.`

## Gameplay
The goal is to survive 90s inside the arena, and after that defeat all enemies.
You can move the avatar with WASD, aim with Mouse, and shoot with Left mouse button.

## Assets
Some assets were created by me, other used by the courtesy of OpenGameArt.org.
